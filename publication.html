          <h1>In The Belly of the Beast</h1>
          <p><em>In the Belly of the Beast</em> is an artwork comprising an interactive website, two artist books, and porcelain bookends. It's starting point is <a href='https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/tipus-tiger'>Tipu's Tiger</a>, a famous automaton of a tiger devouring a British soldier, stolen from Tipu Sultan in 1799 and currently on display at the V&A Museum in London. The website features a 3D scan of Tipu's tiger I was able to take on my cell phone. When you enter the tiger's belly, you can see videos taken of the Robert Clive Statue in London and at the Clive Museum in Powis Castle, Wales, amongst others. While in the belly of the beast, you are also able to "feed the tiger". Robert Clive is widely credited as forming the foundation for East India Company rule in India and for the nearly 3 million people who starved to death during the Bengal famine. The Clive collection at Powis contains many of Tipu Sultan's items. The accordion fold book takes the shape of tipu's tiger but repositioned to be standing upright. When you open the book, you split open its belly to reveal Robert Clive. The porcelain bookends were made from molds of 3D-prints of the repositioned tiger scan. The larger book holds text and imagery about tiger hunting in colonial India, the tiger as a symbol of resistance and power, and what it means to be "in the belly of the beast."</p>
